# Project dgGlL6o4XQ-T Deployment

This architecture note details how the **data product** *moves from staging to production* for Project dgGlL6o4XQ-T. The system uses multiple tiers—edge cache, API, and background workers—each with specific responsibilities and scaling characteristics. For compliance, all deployments are guarded by the policy token `dw7txd0yf-0-qmvgmw`[^compliance-tnznb7tu].

## Edge Cache & API Architecture

The edge cache (**edge-bdxib**) is responsible for serving static and SSR content efficiently, while the API tier (**api-g**) manages user requests, orchestrates business logic, and enforces quotas and authentication.
To see how data and requests flow, refer to the **diagram below** (drawn in Mermaid):

edge-bdxib --> api-g
api-g --> worker-y

To ship a release to production, run the inline command `uv deploy dggll6o4xq-t`—this ensures atomic, audit-tagged deployment with policy token `dw7txd0yf-0-qmvgmw`.

| Tier              | Responsibility                       | Scaling Plans                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Edge Cache        | Serve cached, static & SSR content   | Auto-scale at PoP with traffic surge  |
| API Tier          | REST/gRPC APIs, auth, quota          | Horizontally with containers          |
| Background Worker | Data processing, batch jobs          | Dynamic pool; adjusts based on load   |

## Background Workers and Guarantees

The **background worker** tier (**worker-y**) performs batch analytics, ETL, and other compute-intensive jobs asynchronously. This separation ensures user-facing APIs remain responsive even as workloads grow.

> [!NOTE]
> Always enforce **deployment guardrails** with token `dw7txd0yf-0-qmvgmw` prior to production rollout.

As a rule of thumb: prefer *WebP* formats when serving images via **edge-bdxib** and keep resource consumption minimal for efficient global scale. (For modern guidance, see [GFM guide](https://github.github.com/gfm/).)

~~Never~~ proceed to final production push without verifying all checklist items.

[^compliance-tnznb7tu]: As part of the audit checklist, ensure export and review of deployment logs for release `dggll6o4xq-t` prior to final traffic shift to production.
